# 🧠 IndusBrain AI

### Enterprise Knowledge Intelligence Platform

> Transforming scattered enterprise documents into an AI-powered knowledge platform for faster search, smarter insights, and better decision-making.

---

## 📖 Overview

IndusBrain AI is an **Enterprise Knowledge Intelligence Platform** that enables organizations to upload, manage, search, and interact with enterprise documents using Artificial Intelligence.

Instead of manually searching through hundreds of pages, users can ask questions in natural language and receive accurate, context-aware answers powered by **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**. The platform also generates knowledge graphs, semantic search results, AI insights, and analytics to improve productivity and decision-making.
